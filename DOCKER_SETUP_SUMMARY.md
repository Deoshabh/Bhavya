# Docker Deployment Setup Summary

## Created Files

I've created a complete Docker deployment setup for your Bhavya Events platform optimized for Dokploy deployment:

### 1. **Dockerfile** (Updated)

- Multi-stage build for optimal image size
- Production-ready with security best practices
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine for smaller footprint
- Includes health checks and proper signal handling
- Pre-configured with your MongoDB connection string

### 2. **.dockerignore**

- Optimized to exclude unnecessary files
- Reduces build context size and improves build speed
- Excludes development files, logs, and node_modules

### 3. **docker-compose.yml**

- Complete stack definition for local testing
- Includes MongoDB and Redis services
- Volume mounts for persistent data
- Environment variables template

### 4. **DOKPLOY_DEPLOYMENT.md**

- Comprehensive deployment guide for Dokploy
- Step-by-step instructions
- Environment variables configuration
- Security checklist and troubleshooting

### 5. **Build Scripts**

- `build-and-test.sh` (Linux/macOS)
- `build-and-test.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
- Automated build and testing process

### 6. **mongo-init.js**

- MongoDB initialization script
- Creates necessary collections and indexes

## Key Features

## Quick Start

### For Local Testing:

```bash
# Build and test the image
./build-and-test.sh

# Or run with docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

### For Dokploy Deployment:

1. Follow the `DOKPLOY_DEPLOYMENT.md` guide
2. Configure environment variables in Dokploy
3. Set up volume mounts for `/app/uploads` and `/app/logs`
4. Deploy using the provided Dockerfile

## Environment Variables Required

### Essential:

- `DB_URI`: Already set to your MongoDB connection
- `JWT_SECRET`: For authentication tokens
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Your domain (e.g., https://bhavya.org.in)

### Optional but Recommended:

- Email service configuration
- Payment gateway keys (Razorpay/Stripe)
- Cloudinary for image uploads

## MongoDB Connection

The Dockerfile is pre-configured with your MongoDB connection string:

```
mongodb://admin:StrongPassword123@mongo-db-mongodb-avaxdz:27017/bhavya_Events?authSource=admin
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Locally**: Use the build scripts to test the Docker image
2. **Deploy to Dokploy**: Follow the deployment guide
3. **Configure Environment**: Set up all required environment variables
4. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure health checks and logging
5. **Backup Strategy**: Implement database and file backups

## Support

The deployment guide includes troubleshooting sections and common issues. The Docker setup is production-ready and follows industry best practices for security and performance.
